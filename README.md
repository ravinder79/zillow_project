## Deliverables
* Find major drivers of home Prices
* Deliverable 1: Presentation slides (Audience == Zillow Team)

* Deliverable 2: Repo containing Jupyter Notebook displaying your work through the pipeline with detailed documentation.

* Deliverable 3: .py modules containing functions that ensure your work is reproducible.

* Deliverable 4: README.md

***


## Install pyGAM (https://pygam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) before running jupyter notebook. This library is needed to GAM models i used

***


## SQL Data Acquisition 
Must use your own env file to access data.

* Choose home transaction during May and June 2017 only.

* Single-unit residential properties only
***

## Hypothesis Testing
Lets do some hypothesis testing 

* $H_0$: there is no relationship between home values and number of bedrooms, bathrooms and square_feet.

* $H_a$: There is a relationship between home values and number of bedrooms, bathrooms and square_feet
***

## Technical Skills used

* Python
* SQL
* Various data science libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib etc)
* Stats (Hypothesis testing, correlation tests)
* Linear Regression (Single Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Generalized Additive Models, Ridge Regression)

# Executive Summary
* We created a logistic regression model to predict customers who are likely to churn.
* The model is able to correctly predict 80% of customers who actually churn.
* Customers most likely to churn:\
** Month to month contract\
** New customers (tenure less than 2 years)\
** Have fiber optic internet
* Focus resources on retaining ‘new’ customers since company does fine retaining the longer tenured customers
